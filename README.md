# FOCUSADD
Flexible Optimized Curves in Space with Automatic Differentiation (Duh)

# What is FOCUSADD?

FOCUSADD is a tool which performs numerical optimization of a class of fusion reactors called Stellarators. FOCUSADD is a simplified and rewritten version of [FOCUS][https://princetonuniversity.github.io/FOCUS/publications.html], a stellarator coil design code. FOCUSADD is written entirely in Python. 

FOCUSADD uses Automatic Differentiation (powered by [google/JAX][https://github.com/google/jax]) to compute the derivatives which will be used for optimization.
